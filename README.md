# Echo-Chamber-detection-topological-and-semantic-analysis
Master thesis project developed to identify and quantify the presence of Echo Chambers inside the Twitter platform
Description


BERT SMALL L4 training ground of truth: script containing the training and test phase of a BERT model. The Neural Network is trained in order to recognize Pro Trump and Anti Trump tweets


Master Thesis EDA&PreProcessing-phase1: Exploration and Pre Processing of the dataset used to develop the project


MasterThesis GraphBuilding: first construction and representation of the graphs


MasterThesis_Community_detection_phase3 VADER: in the notebook it is injected the semantic of the text directly in the community detection phase.  It was applied a sentiment analysis index to each Tweet and evaluate the average polarity index, obtained from the output of the BERT model. A distance measure is then calculated in order to idenitify similar tweets from the sentiment and polarity point of view


MasterThesis Community Detection evaluation phase 4: application of indexes to evaluate how well the communities are separated and choesive. Representation of the most common tokens inside each community found
